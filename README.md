# Rocket_controller
This project aims to design and build a microcontroller-based Rocket guide controller that travels to its destination based on a selected map direction. The map directions are based on cardinal directions north, south, east and west. A cookbook of North is equal to 1, south is equal to 2, east is equal to 3, and south is equal to 4, respectfully, is used in this design. The system has a used button to scroll through the directions. A set button to choose the direction and a start button to start the rocket phases. Furthermore, a motor, seven-segment display and buzzer must be interfaced with a microcontroller. The motor is used to control the direction that the rocket travels. The seven-segment display is used to display direction using its numerical equivalents, airtime during each phase, and the total airtime and distance when the process is finished. An audio output is produced using a buzzer which is used to signal the end of each phase and incorrect direction input. The microcontroller used for this project is the PIC16F690.
